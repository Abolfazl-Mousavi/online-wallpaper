An audio player for YouTube videos: https://ytaud.io/

YTAudio is a progressive web app that allows you to listen to YouTube videos in the background. It runs in the browser and uses modern browser-interfaces (like the [MediaSession API](https://dev.to/nicomartin/media-session-api-c1j), the Web Share API and the Share Target API) in combination with a ServiceWorker and a Web App Manifest to deliver an App-Like User Experience.
