An audio player for YouTube videos: https://ytaud.io/

YouTube Audio is a progressive web app that allows you to listen to YouTube videos in the background. It runs in the browser and uses modern browser-interfaces (like the MediaSession API, the Web Share API and the Share Target API) in combination with a ServiceWorker and a Web App Manifest to deliver an App-Like User Experience.
